# ML_University_practical_work
While studying at the Financial University under the government of the Russian Federation, I had a course on machine learning. In this repository, I have collected most of the practical work. The study was in Russian, so the comments and conclusions were made in Russian.

Themes:
* Лаб 4. Linear classification
* Лаб 5. Text and Image Embedding 
* Лаб 6. Selection of features, overfitting and underfitting
